KeePassQRCodeView
=================================

OVERVIEW
-----
KeePassQRCodeView is a plug-in for KeePass 2.x which shows QR Codes for entry fields. These codes can be scanned to copy the encoded data to the scanner (smartphone, ...).

> Note: The QR Codes get generated by the plugin without the use of a web service or something. So no sensitive data leave the application.
